# Task Management Application

This is a task management application developed with Angular and Firebase. It allows users to efficiently register, organize, and complete tasks. This README file provides an overview of the project, highlights relevant points, and covers important considerations.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create an account, log in, and securely manage their tasks.
- **Task Creation:** Users can add new tasks with details such as title, due date, priority, etc.
- **Task Listing:** Provides an organized view of all pending and completed tasks. 
- **Task Deletion:** Users can delete existing tasks as needed.
- **Task Status:** Tasks can be marked as completed, helping users track their progress.
- **Integration with Firebase:** Firebase is used as the backend for data storage and user authentication.

## Design Pattern

The application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern, which separates the concerns of data manipulation (Model), user interface (View), and business logic (Controller). This promotes maintainability, scalability, and reusability of code.

## Programming Paradigms

The application utilizes the following programming paradigms:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** OOP principles are employed to organize code into objects with encapsulated data and behavior, promoting modularity and code reuse.
- **Reactive Programming:** Reactive programming concepts using RxJS are utilized for handling asynchronous operations, managing streams of data, and event-based programming.

## Directives

Angular's directives are leveraged to enhance the functionality and interactivity of the application. The following directives are utilized:

- **ngIf:** Used to conditionally display elements based on specific conditions, such as showing or hiding task details.
- **ngFor:** Employed to iterate over collections and generate repetitive elements, such as displaying a list of tasks.
- **ngModel:** Used for two-way data binding, allowing seamless synchronization between the user interface and the underlying data model.
